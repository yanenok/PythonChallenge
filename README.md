## Level 0
2^38 = 274877906944

## Level 1
Level1a was my initial solution, which I thought was not very elegant, but did the task.
The translation of the text gave me a hint about maketrans, so I decided to implement this solution as well in Level1b.

## Level 2
Using OrderedDict to get keys in order they appear.

## Level 3
Looking for strictly 3 upperCase characters to the left and to the right of 1 lowerCase symbol.

## Level 4
Looking for a number after "and the next nothing is ". The loop prints each message and stops when a different text is found. Parts 4-2 and 4-3 start off with the numbers from those instructions.
